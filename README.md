# Human Grader Project

This project is made with vite. In order to run clone the repo and run the following commands :
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
The project is made using the Tanstack Headless Table component. It consists of a simple table with horizontal overflow.
The rows can be expanded and collapsed. There is basic pagination and column toggles. Currently there is no error handling in case of file upload failure.
